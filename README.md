# Champions 6E for Foundry v10

Warning: this system is at best very much WIP. It is, as yet, a pointless idea to try to use it unless you're like literally the person I'm making this package for.

## Suggested installation for testing

If you are person I'm making it for, however, here's my suggestion for how to install it: clone it with Git into the `systems` subdirectory of your Foundry data directory.

Then you can just `git pull` and restart or reload (F5) Foundry to pull in new changes as I work on it!
